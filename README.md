# Explain what is it and how to create a perl code in that
# This is a Perl script that integrates with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to authenticate users and obtain security tokens.
# It uses the SOAP::Lite module to make SOAP requests to the ADFS server and retrieve security tokens for a given user.
# The script is designed to work with ADFS 2.0 and requires the following parameters:
# - $username: The username of the user to authenticate.
# - $password: The password of the user to authenticate.
# - $adfs_url: The URL of the ADFS server.
